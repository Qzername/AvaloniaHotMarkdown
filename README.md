# AvaloniaHotMarkdown

A work-in-progress prototype of an Obsidian-inspired live-preview Markdown editor for Avalonia.

This was made for my private project that maybe I will release later on. For this reason this project is heavily incomplete as I don't need anything special.

**This project does not have NuGet package yet.** As I mentioned earlier, this project is a prototype and I will release NuGet package when all the features mentioned below are fully implemented.
